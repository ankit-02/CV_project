# Project Title

End-to-End License Plate Detection and Recognition

## Objective
The aim of this project is to detect a License Plate(LP) in Image of vehicle and than recoginize the corresponding LP number simultaneously with high speed and accuracy.

## Approches
We use 10 Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) layers to extract features from the input image and then use some fully connected layers for prediction of the bounding box around the License Plate. After detection of LP we use the "Recognition Module" which exploits Region of Interest(ROI) to extract features map of interest and several classifiers to predict the corresponding license plate number
